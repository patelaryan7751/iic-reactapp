# Developer guide for working in this repo

- Everything is split in components.
- Each components has its own folder.
- Each components folder is named with its __first__ letter as __capital__ then all letters small with __underscore__ in place of __space__ if required.
- Each components folder should contain its main Javascript file along with its css and the __props__ needed for that specific component.
- For __props__ that is needed for more than one components is placed in the __Global_props__ folder.
- Each props should follow the same rules that each components follow.
- __Important___ try to build this app using _Functional Programming_, you can go for Class Programming if the environment demands and that feature can not be completed by Functional Programming.
- Try to keep the code clean and avoid code reuse (Specially the Css part).
- Implementing libraries and additional dependencies are welcomed but make sure you are using it, if not remove it from the _pacakage.json_ or contact Chandrasekhar.

### Happy coding
